# AGENTS.md — guide for AI contributors

This file is the contract between PrismCore and any AI coding agent working on
it — **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Gemini**, **Copilot**, **Cursor**, or
whatever opens this repository next. Read it in full before changing anything.
Humans: it works as onboarding too.

## Fast read order

1. [`README.md`](README.md) — what the engine handles and how to call it
2. `AGENTS.md` *(this file)* — how we work, and what has already bitten us
3. [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) — what actually landed, newest first

Then open Swift files, starting from `PrismCoreSession` (the front door).

### The engine in one paragraph

PrismCore turns media `AVPlayer` cannot open into media it can. The **remux
path** (the main one) demuxes with libavformat, stream-copies video and audio
into HLS-fMP4 on disk, and serves it from a loopback HTTP server — so the host
plays a plain `AVPlayer` and keeps hardware decode, PiP, AirPlay, native track
selection and the tvOS display handshake. Nothing is re-encoded, so Atmos stays
object audio and Dolby Vision stays Dolby Vision (Profile 7 is converted to 8.1
in flight). The **software path** is a real player for what AVPlayer cannot
decode at all (VP9, MPEG-2, VC-1, verified-interlaced H.264): libavcodec into an
`AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` with its own clock. `PrismCoreEngine.decide` picks
between them; a host that has no surface for the software path can decline it
and route elsewhere.

## House rules

- **Never copy code from AetherEngine.** It is prior art we study for
  *approach* only (LGPL-3.0 vs our LGPL-2.1+, and it is someone else's work).
  Read it, describe the mechanism in your own words, then design ours. Saying
  "convergent with AetherEngine" in a PR is good; lifting a function is not.
- **Comments explain *why*, never *what*.** A comment that restates the line
  above it is noise. A comment that records the failure a line prevents is the
  most valuable thing in this repo — most of the notes below started as one.
- **Claims need evidence.** "This is faster" means a measurement in the PR body.
  "This works" means a test or a named device run. See *Measuring* below for the
  trap that already caught us once.
- **Every release gets a CHANGELOG entry**, and every changed behaviour gets its
  reasoning recorded — including the things we tried and reverted, which are
  often more useful than what shipped.

## Field notes — the things that cost hours

These are all real. Each one was found the hard way; none is obvious from the
API surface.

### FFmpeg / libavformat

- **`avformat_find_stream_info` is not optional, and not just knowledge.** It
  also fills fields the *muxer* needs — an EAC3 track's frame size most
  sharply. A context that skipped it produces a perfectly correct-looking
  manifest and then fails on `av_interleaved_write_frame` (`-22`). This is why
  the probe hands over its **context** (`ProbedSource`), never merely its
  conclusions. Tried the other way in 1.1.2; reverted the same day.
- **`interrupt_callback` must be set BEFORE `avformat_open_input`.** The read
  path checks `URLContext.interrupt_callback` (`libavformat/avio.c:515`), which
  is populated when the context is created (`avio.c:189`). Setting it on the
  `AVFormatContext` afterwards reaches only the few places that read
  `s->interrupt_callback` directly — *not* the blocking reads. 1.1.1's bounded
  index-load seek made exactly this mistake and bounded nothing; since 1.3.1
  every open site installs a permanent, disarmed `ReadInterruptGuard` at
  `avformat_alloc_context` time and arms it only around the seek. Two
  corollaries: the guard must travel with an adopted context (`ProbedSource`
  carries it), and an aborted read latches `AVERROR_EXIT` in
  `AVIOContext.error`, which has to be cleared before the context can read
  again.
- **Container-level aspect ratio lives on `AVStream.sample_aspect_ratio`**, not
  in codecpar. An MKV's `DisplayWidth`/`Height` — how anamorphic DVD rips are
  tagged — is dropped by a codecpar-only copy. FFmpeg's *own* hls demuxer has
  the same bug (`hls.c:2040`), which is why the SAR test asserts on the `pasp`
  box bytes of the served init segment rather than re-probing the playlist.
- **A Matroska without Cues turns any timestamp seek into a linear scan** of
  the whole container. On a 5.4 GB file over SMB that is 66 s for one seek. Do
  not assume a seek is bounded because the file is "local".
- **`AV_FRAME_FLAG_INTERLACED` is `1 << 3`.** `1 << 2` is `DISCARD`. Using the
  wrong one makes every stream look progressive and the mistake is invisible
  without a test.
- **A subtitle codec context needs `pkt_timebase` set before `avcodec_open2`**,
  or `AVSubtitle.pts` stays `NOPTS` and every decoded event is silently
  dropped. Cost: 2000 PGS packets, 0 cues, no error anywhere.
- **`av_seek_frame` trips assertions in `matroskadec.c`** with nested elements;
  prefer `avformat_seek_file`, and flush after seeking.

### Building the FFmpeg xcframeworks

- **A build can succeed and silently ship without the feature you built it
  for.** FFmpeg's configure does not fail on an unmet filter dependency — it
  logs `WARNING: Disabled <x> because not all dependencies are satisfied: …`
  and carries on. Check `config_components.h` for the `CONFIG_*` define (filter
  and codec defines live there, not in `config.h`) **before** publishing
  anything. Two full builds were published-ready and useless before this rule
  existed.
- **The Metal toolchain is registered to one Xcode.** `yadif_videotoolbox`
  needs Metal, which in Xcode 26 is a separate download
  (`xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`) installed as a *cryptex
  mount* tied to a single Xcode installation. Point `DEVELOPER_DIR` at a
  different one and `xcrun metal` fails — which is easy to do, because
  `DEVELOPER_DIR` also has to be set for an unrelated reason (below). Check
  with `xcrun -sdk macosx metal --version` **under the same `DEVELOPER_DIR` the
  build will use**.
- **MPVKit's build scripts sanitize their subprocess environment**, dropping
  `DEVELOPER_DIR` — so every `xcrun --sdk …` resolves against `xcode-select`,
  which on a machine with Command Line Tools installed means no tvOS/xrOS SDK
  and a build that dies partway through. Patch `Utility.launch` to propagate it.

### Muxing to fMP4 (`FMP4SegmentWriter`, `HLSRemuxer`)

- **movenc defaults HEVC to `hev1`, not `hvc1`.** Apple's HLS rules want
  `hvc1`, and `HVCCNormalizer` asserts `array_completeness = 1`, which
  contradicts `hev1` — movenc resolves that by writing **no `hvcC` box at
  all**. Set the fourcc explicitly.
- **The `hvcC` is normalized twice on purpose**: on the input extradata, and
  again on the produced init segment, because the muxer rebuilds the record
  when it writes the sample entry.
- **`delay_moov` is mandatory for EAC3.** movenc builds the `dec3` sample entry
  from parsed packets and refuses an up-front moov.
- Dolby Vision Profile 5 needs the `dvh1` fourcc — an `hvc1` entry over P5
  decodes to green-and-purple. Profile 8.x deliberately keeps `hvc1`, because
  its base layer *is* the fallback.

### tvOS display handshake (`DisplayCriteriaController`)

- Criteria must be programmed and settled **before** the host loads the
  playlist. tvOS validates an HDR variant's `VIDEO-RANGE` against the panel's
  *current* mode, synchronously — a PQ master handed to an SDR-parked panel
  fails outright (`-11868`), it does not switch or tone-map.
- **The in-progress flag clearing is ambiguous on an HDR target.** A panel that
  finished quietly and one that aborted the switch look identical at that
  moment. Since 1.1.0 the settle keeps watching for a real HDR signal and
  reports `clearedWithoutHDRSignal` if none comes.
- Panels advertise HDR they cannot usefully *display*. One 1080p set in the
  field accepts HDR10 and shows it washed out; the honest answer there is SDR,
  and the rejection fallback already produces it.

## Measuring

There is an opt-in harness: `StartupCostBenchmark`, enabled by pointing
`PRISMCORE_BENCH` at real media (a path **or an `http://` URL`**). It breaks
startup into probe / second open / `start()` / first fetch.

**Measure over HTTP, not a mounted share.** This already caught us out: an
SMB-mounted file reads locally and cached, so the double-open measured as 21 ms
of noise and the conclusion ("not worth fixing") was wrong. The same work over
HTTP was hundreds of milliseconds, twice per playback. Hosts reach media over
the network; benchmark the transport they actually use.

Byte-counting through a toy HTTP server is unreliable for the same class of
reason: an open-ended range means the server keeps writing until the client
hangs up, so "bytes served" includes socket slack and varies run to run. Prefer
repeated timings with a warm cache, and report the spread, not one number.

**The benchmark server must support Range requests.** `python3 -m http.server`
does not — it answers every Range with a 200 and the whole file, libavformat
concludes the stream cannot seek, the Matroska Cues at the tail never load, and
every plan silently degrades to the uniform basis (no demand mode at all). The
same file over a Range-capable server plans on the keyframe index. If a
benchmark shows `basis=uniform` on a file that has Cues, suspect the server
before the planner.

## Testing

- Swift Testing. `swift test --filter` matches **function names**, not the
  display strings in `@Test("…")`. Filtering on a suite title silently runs
  nothing ("No matching test cases were run").
- Some tests need Xcode's toolchain rather than the Command Line Tools —
  `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer swift test`. A
  missing `Testing.framework` at *runtime* is this, not a broken test.
- **Opt-in harnesses for what a fixture cannot carry**, gated on an environment
  variable so CI stays hermetic:
  - `PRISMCORE_MEDIA` — real-media probe/DV verification
  - `PRISMCORE_PGS_MEDIA` — the OCR subtitle pipeline (no FFmpeg build can
    *encode* PGS, so there is no committable fixture)
  - `PRISMCORE_BENCH` — startup cost
- Fixtures are synthetic (`testsrc2` + `sine`), generated with system `ffmpeg`
  and committed under `Tests/PrismCoreTests/Fixtures/`. They prove the
  pipeline, never the premium claims — Atmos and Dolby Vision need real media
  and a device.

## Releasing

1. Land the change with a CHANGELOG entry under a new version heading, plus the
   link at the bottom of the file.
2. `git tag X.Y.Z` — **always three components**. SPM only resolves full semver
   tags; a `1.2` tag is invisible to consumers. (Release *titles* may drop a
   trailing zero if you like; tags may not.)
3. `gh release create X.Y.Z` with notes that say what changed and why. Since
   1.0.0 this project follows full semver: breaking → major, feature → minor,
   fix → patch.
4. **Bump the host pin in two places or not at all.** Aether pins PrismCore
   exactly, in `project.yml` (`exactVersion:`) *and*
   `ci_scripts/Package.resolved.pinned`. Bumping one silently gives devices and
   TestFlight different engines — that happened (local 0.1.11, cloud 0.1.6) and
   is why the pin is exact.

## Repository shape

```
Sources/PrismCore/
  PrismCoreSession.swift     the front door: start() → playlist URL, stop()
  PrismCoreEngine.swift      decide(for:) — remux vs software vs decline
  Probe/                     SourceProbe, ProbedSource, DisplayCapabilities,
                             SourceOpenTuning (read caps)
  Remux/                     HLSRemuxer (the producer), FMP4SegmentWriter,
                             AudioBridge, SegmentPlan, DemandCoordinator
  Loopback/                  LoopbackHTTPServer + segment providers
  Subtitles/                 WebVTT renditions, bitmap decode + OCR
  Display/                   tvOS criteria + settle
  Software/                  the decode-and-render path
Tests/PrismCoreTests/        Swift Testing, fixtures, opt-in harnesses
```

The host contract is deliberately small: build a session, `start()`, play the
URL, `stop()`. Everything else is the engine's business.
