/// text: AVPlayer times a `SUBTITLES` rendition on its own segment schedule,
/// which is where the late-cue drift class of bugs lives, while a host that
/// draws captions itself wants the cue list on the player's own clock. Plex's
/// subtitle-only transcode turned out to answer empty documents for embedded
/// tracks (Aether#1533), so "ask the server for the text" is not a route — the
/// demux this engine already runs is the one honest source of embedded cues.
///
/// Times are **seconds on the played timeline**: the source's presentation
/// origin (first video PTS) is already subtracted, so a host can compare them
/// directly against `AVPlayerItem.currentTime()` of the played playlist.
