/// Bytes supplied by the **host** instead of by libavformat's own protocols.
///
/// The engine can natively open whatever libavformat can (`file:`, `http:`,
/// …), which leaves out every source whose bytes only the host can reach: an
/// SMB share mounted through the host's own client, a debrid or torrent
/// session, an encrypted local store, a file inside a disc image. Those hosts
/// used to have no way in at all; this is it.
///
/// Implementations are read-only and position-based. `read` fills as much of
/// `buffer` as it can and returns how many bytes it wrote — **`0` means end of
/// stream**, never "nothing available right now": libavformat treats a zero
/// return as EOF, so an implementation that would otherwise return 0 has to
/// block until it has a byte or throw.
///
/// Errors thrown from either method reach FFmpeg as a negative return code and
/// are re-surfaced to the caller as `PrismCoreInputError.readFailed` /
/// `.seekFailed`, wrapping the host's own error — a failing transport must
/// come back as a typed failure, not as a session that hangs waiting for a
/// playlist that will never be written.
///
/// `Sendable` because the engine reads on whichever thread owns the context
/// that open produced (a probe thread, the producer thread, the preview
/// actor's). Each open gets its **own** instance from the factory, so an
/// implementation never has to be safe for *concurrent* use — only for use
/// from a thread that is not the one that created it.

/// The plain protocol has no way out of a blocked call. `ReadInterruptGuard`
/// bounds blocking operations with FFmpeg's `interrupt_callback`, which FFmpeg
/// polls *between* reads — so it reaches libavformat's own I/O and stops dead
/// at the edge of a host's synchronous `read(into:)`. An SMB share whose
/// server went away, or a debrid link that stopped feeding, therefore parks the
/// calling thread for as long as the host's own transport takes to give up:
/// minutes, or never. That thread is the probe's, or the producer's — and a
/// parked producer is what used to make `PrismCoreSession.stop()` hang, which
/// in a host app is a frozen UI.
///
/// Conforming is what gives the engine a way in.
///
/// **The contract, both halves.** The engine promises to call
/// `cancelInFlightOperation()` whenever the read guard on this input's context
/// becomes interrupted — an expired probe/index-load budget, or an explicit
/// cancellation such as `stop()`. The host promises that the `read` or `seek`
/// blocked at that moment then *returns*, promptly, in one of two ways the
/// engine accepts equally:
///
/// - **throwing** — the usual shape, and the one that carries a reason. What
///   is thrown is recorded as `PrismCoreInputError.readFailed` /
///   `.seekFailed`, but on an interrupted context it is the abort, not the
///   error, that decides the outcome, so a plain "cancelled" error is fine;
/// - **a short count**, `0` included. Zero normally means end of stream —
///   `read(into:)` says so — but a read released by a cancellation is read
///   back as the abort it is and never as EOF, because the engine knows it
///   asked. A short positive count is simply the bytes that did arrive.
///
/// Both are honoured only while the guard is interrupted. A host that returns
/// `0` at any *other* moment is still declaring EOF.
///
/// Two requirements on the implementation:
///
/// - **it may be called concurrently with `read` or `seek`** — that is the
///   whole point — so it must not take a lock those hold, and must not touch
///   state they mutate without its own synchronization. Waking a socket,
///   cancelling a `URLSessionTask`, setting an atomic flag: all fine;
/// - **it may be called when nothing is in flight**, and must then do nothing.
///   The engine cannot see inside the host, so it never guesses; a deadline
///   that expires between two reads calls this against an idle input.
///
/// An input that does *not* conform keeps working exactly as before. The
/// engine checks for this conformance once, when it installs the input, and
/// leaves a notice in the unified log when it is absent — so a thread wedged
/// an hour later has a breadcrumb instead of being a mystery.

/// those contexts read from completely different positions at the same time.
/// One shared instance would have them fighting over a single cursor: the
/// producer's sequential read and a scrub preview's seek would interleave into
/// garbage, intermittently, on exactly the sources hardest to debug. A factory
/// makes a shared cursor impossible to express by accident.
///
/// **It can be called again in the middle of playback.** A planned session
/// whose read fails mid-film re-opens its source rather than ending (see
/// `PlaybackEvent.producerRecovered`), and a re-open is an open: one more
/// call, up to three a minute, for an instance that starts at byte zero. The
/// previous instance is released first. So the factory must be callable at
/// any time from any thread, must hand out an instance that reads the same
/// bytes as the first one did, and should reconnect rather than return the
/// broken transport the last instance was using — a factory that hands back
/// the dead session turns every recovery into a failed one.
