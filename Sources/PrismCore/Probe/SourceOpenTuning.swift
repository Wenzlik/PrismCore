/// that hide their structure. The ones PrismCore takes describe themselves in
/// their header: Matroska carries CodecPrivate, MP4 carries the whole `moov`.
/// Measured against a 5.4 GB HEVC/EAC3 remux over HTTP, one open cost
/// **1.31 MB across 3 requests** at the defaults and **0.92 MB** capped — and
/// on a living-room Wi-Fi link to a media server that difference is the
/// visible part of "Preparing…", paid twice because the routing probe and the
/// remuxer each open the source.
///
/// The caps are a *ceiling*, not a target: libavformat stops as soon as it has
/// what it needs, so a well-formed file reads far less than either number.
/// What they bound is the pathological case — sparse audio, junk streams, a
/// container that never settles — where the analysis would otherwise read
/// megabytes to learn nothing new.
