import Foundation

/// The fuzzable surface of every hand-written bitstream parser in this module,
/// as uniform `bytes in → invariants checked` entry points.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// The parsers below read **untrusted media** — a downloaded MKV's `hvcC`, an
/// E-AC-3 packet off any server, a sidecar `.srt` someone found on the internet
/// — and none of them is FFmpeg's code, so none of them is covered by FFmpeg's
/// fuzzing. Each has unit tests pinning the *rules*; what a fixture cannot pin
/// is the absence of a crash, hang, or corrupt-output path on inputs nobody
/// thought to write down. That is a fuzzer's job.
///
/// ## Why it lives inside the module
///
/// Two consumers share this table — the deterministic smoke test that runs in
/// every CI build (`FuzzSmokeTests`), and the coverage-guided libFuzzer
/// executable (`prismcore-fuzz`) — and an executable target cannot
/// `@testable import` in a release build. `package` access gives both of them
/// the same symbols without making anything public, and a host app never pays
/// for it: nothing in the library references this type, so it dead-strips.
///
/// ## The contract of a target
///
/// A target takes arbitrary bytes, calls its parser, and checks the invariants
/// that make a *wrong* answer visible, not just a crashing one. A violated
/// invariant calls `fatalError` — under libFuzzer that is a saved crash input,
/// in the smoke test it is a failed run with the seed printed. Targets must be
/// deterministic and free of I/O: a fuzzer that touches the filesystem
/// measures the filesystem.
