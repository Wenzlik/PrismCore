/// v0 grew an EVENT playlist as it produced, so AVPlayer only knew about
/// segments that already existed and a seek past the produced window had
/// nowhere to go. A plan enumerates EVERY segment before playback: the
/// playlist can be published complete (real VOD, ENDLIST and all), AVPlayer
/// seeks by simply fetching the segment at the target, and the producer's job
/// becomes "make the requested segment exist" instead of "run to EOF".
///
/// Boundaries follow the same shape v0 cut live: segment N ends at the first
/// video keyframe at-or-after `(N+1) × targetSeconds`, so every segment opens
/// decodable on its own. The keyframe positions come from the demuxer's index
/// (Matroska Cues / MP4 `stss`+`stts`, loaded by a bounded seek); an index is
/// only trusted past two witnesses, because index quality varies wildly:
///
/// - **gap**: the largest distance between consecutive keyframes must stay
///   under a cap. A clustered MPEG-TS index can gap by thousands of seconds,
///   and trusting it would plan a single monstrous segment.
/// - **coverage**: the indexed keyframes must span at least one target
///   duration. A remote MKV whose Cues tail read failed leaves only the
///   open-time keyframes, bunched at the head — tiny gaps (witness 1 passes)
///   but nothing reaches even the first boundary.
///
/// An untrusted index degrades to a **uniform plan**: fixed-duration entries
/// whose positions are timestamps, not keyframes. The producer then seeks by
/// time and cuts at whatever keyframe the demuxer lands on — less precise,
/// never wrong (a landed keyframe is still a keyframe).
