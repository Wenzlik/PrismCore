///
/// This is deliberately its own small pipeline, not a reuse of the playback
/// paths, and independent of which engine is actually *playing* the title:
///
/// - It opens its **own context**. An `AVFormatContext` is not safe for
///   concurrent use, and the producer's is busy producing — a thumbnail
///   request must never stall playback, only itself.
/// - It decodes on the **CPU only**. A thumbnail is one keyframe scaled to
///   ~300 px: VideoToolbox would win milliseconds and cost a hardware session
///   per preview strip, plus the fallback complexity playback genuinely
///   needs and this doesn't. `sws_scale` also IS the delivery format step —
///   the decode and the downscale are one pipeline stage here.
/// - The image comes back as a `CGImage`, because the only consumer is a HUD
///   about to draw it. No `CVPixelBuffer`, no `CMSampleBuffer` — those exist
///   for renderers.
///
/// A request decodes the keyframe at-or-before the timestamp (`av_seek_frame`
/// BACKWARD lands there; keyframes decode standalone, so one packet usually
/// suffices) and the result is cached by the keyframe's PTS: scrubbing within
/// one GOP is a dictionary hit, not a decode. When the source has a harvested
/// keyframe map (`KeyframeIndexCache`, issue #34), requests resolve to their
/// keyframe *before* seeking, so even the first touch of a GOP that is
/// already cached skips the demuxer entirely.
///
/// Known caveats, accepted for v1: HDR (PQ/HLG) sources are converted by
/// matrix, not tone-mapped — previews look flatter than the picture. Dolby
/// Vision Profile 5 (IPT-PQc2) has no honest RGB conversion here at all; the
