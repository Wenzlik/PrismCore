/// Issue #35, the audio half: the software pipeline enumerates its source's
/// audio tracks and switches between them mid-playback, leaving the clock and
/// the video renderer untouched.
///
/// The fixture (`h264_multi_audio.mkv`) carries two audio tracks the switch
/// can be *observed* across, not just believed: AAC stereo (eng, stream 1) and
/// AC-3 5.1 (ces, stream 2). The decoder preserves channel count, so the
/// renderer-side proof of the switch is the buffers going from 2 to 6
/// channels.
