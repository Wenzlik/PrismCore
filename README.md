## What it is

Any container libavformat can read (MKV, MPEG-TS, AVI, …) is remuxed on the fly
into **HLS-fMP4**, served from a loopback HTTP server on `127.0.0.1`, and handed
to a plain `AVPlayer` as a playlist URL. Not a single frame is re-encoded. Apple's
stack then does what only it can do on its own platforms:

- **hardware decode** (VideoToolbox),
- **Dolby Atmos passthrough** — EAC3+JOC is stream-copied, never decoded to PCM,
- **Dolby Vision** display engagement and the HDMI handshake,
- **Match Content** (frame rate + dynamic range) on tvOS,
- system-side HDR10 / HLG tone-mapping,
- and everything that rides along for free because it *is* AVPlayer: Picture in
  Picture, AirPlay, the Now Playing surface, spatial audio.

On Apple platforms the usual choice is between AVPlayer — deep OS integration,
but only Apple's containers — and an mpv- or VLC-derived engine, which plays
almost anything but renders its own frames and decodes audio to PCM, so Dolby
Vision and Atmos die at its door. PrismCore is the third option: FFmpeg's
container breadth in front of Apple's own playback stack.

For the handful of sources whose *video* AVPlayer cannot decode at all (VP9,
MPEG-2, VC-1, interlaced H.264), there is a software path — libavcodec into
`AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` — so a host has one engine to call rather than two.

## Used by

- **[Aether](https://aetherplayer.com)** — a native media player for Apple
  platforms. PrismCore is the engine every non-Apple container routes through:
  ahead of libmpv, behind plain AVFoundation for the files it can already open.
  Routing arrived in Aether 1.1.0 behind a developer toggle and is on by
  default from 1.1.1.

## What it handles

| Area | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Containers | Anything libavformat demuxes — MKV, MP4, MPEG-TS, AVI, WebM, FLV, … |
| Video (native) | H.264, HEVC (incl. Main 10), AV1 **where the device has a hardware decoder** — asked with `VTIsHardwareDecodeSupported`, not inferred from a chip name |
| Video (software) | VP9 / VP8, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2, VC-1 / WMV3, AV1 without hardware (libdav1d), interlaced H.264 with CPU `bwdif` deinterlace at field rate |
| HDR | HDR10 (PQ) and HLG, signaled honestly in the master playlist and tone-mapped by the system |
| Dolby Vision | Profile 5 (`dvh1` sample entry), 8.1 and 8.4 (`hvc1` + `SUPPLEMENTAL-CODECS`), **Profile 7 converted to single-layer 8.1** through libdovi; 8.2's Rec.709 base plays as plain SDR because that is what it is |
| Dolby Atmos | EAC3+JOC **stream-copied**, and the `dec3` box's TS 103 420 type-A extension re-applied to the init segment — without it AVFoundation plays the same bitstream as plain DD+ |
| Audio (copy) | AAC, AC3, EAC3, FLAC, ALAC — bit-for-bit |
| Audio (bridge) | TrueHD / MLP / DTS / DTS-HD MA / MP3 / MP2 / Opus / Vorbis / PCM → EAC3 5.1, 128 kbps per channel. Needs an FFmpeg build with the **`eac3` encoder**; without it those sources take the software path instead, which decodes them itself |
| Multi-audio | Every viable track becomes an HLS alternate rendition with its language, name and channel count, so AVPlayer gets a real `AVMediaSelectionGroup` to switch on |
| Subtitles (text) | SubRip / ASS / SSA / WebVTT / mov_text converted during the remux read into segmented WebVTT renditions, cut on the video's own boundaries — so text survives PiP and AirPlay instead of living in a host overlay. External `.srt` / `.vtt` register as first-class renditions |
| Subtitles (bitmap) | PGS / DVB / DVD read by on-device Vision OCR into the same rendition machinery. Lossy by design — typography dies, text survives — and the raw tracks stay surfaced for a host that wants to draw them pixel-accurately |
| Seek & cache | Keyframe-aligned segment plan published upfront, demand-driven production with re-anchoring, absolute-`tfdt` continuity across restarts, byte-budgeted retention (1 GiB default; an evicted segment is reproduced on demand, so the budget bounds disk, not seekability) |
| Display | tvOS HDMI handshake driven by the engine: `preferredDisplayCriteria` programmed and settled **before** the item is loaded, which is the only ordering tvOS accepts for HDR HLS |
| Streaming | HTTP headers ride the demux connection (a Plex token, a WebDAV authorization), reconnect on dropped connections |

## Quick start

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Wenzlik/PrismCore.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

One call probes the source, picks the path and hands back something already
started:

```swift
import PrismCore

switch try await PrismCoreEngine.open(url: mkvURL) {
case .remux(let session, let playlist):
    player.replaceCurrentItem(with: AVPlayerItem(url: playlist))   // AVPlayer plays it
    …
    await session.stop()

case .software(let pipeline):
    hostView.layer.addSublayer(pipeline.displayLayer!)             // we play it
    pipeline.play()
    …
    pipeline.stop()
}
```

The remux path is the one that matters — it is what buys hardware decode, Atmos
passthrough and Dolby Vision. Drive it directly when you want the detail:

```swift
let session = try PrismCoreSession(url: mkvURL, display: .current())

// optional, before start(): a sidecar joins the WebVTT renditions
try await session.addExternalSubtitle(url: srtURL, language: "cs", name: "Čeština")

let playlistURL = try await session.start()   // .../master.m3u8 or .../index.m3u8
// hand playlistURL to your AVPlayer
…
await session.stop()
```

The URL is a **master** playlist when the source has audio (that is where the
selectable renditions live) and a media playlist when it hasn't. Treat it as
opaque: the shape is a property of the source, not of the API.

`PrismCoreEngine.decide(for:)` is exposed separately, so a host can ask which
path a source would take — and unit-test its own routing — without standing up
either engine.

### Host setup on tvOS

Over HDMI the panel's mode has to be programmed **before** AVPlayer sees the
playlist. tvOS validates an HDR variant's `VIDEO-RANGE` against the panel's
*current* mode synchronously, so a PQ master handed to an SDR-parked panel fails
outright (`-11848` / `-11868`) instead of switching or tone-mapping. AVKit's
`appliesPreferredDisplayCriteriaAutomatically` cannot help here: it derives
criteria from the chosen variant's format description, which only exists after
the variant passes the very validation the switch has to precede. So it must be
`false`, and the order is engine-driven:

```swift
let controller = DisplayCriteriaController(window: window)   // tvOS only
let session = try PrismCoreSession(url: source, display: .current())
let playlist = try await session.start()

if let choice = await session.displayCriteria {
    controller.apply(choice)                 // 1. program the panel
    await controller.waitForSwitch()         // 2. let the handshake settle
}
player.replaceCurrentItem(with: AVPlayerItem(url: playlist))  // 3. only then load
player.play()
// on teardown: controller.reset()
```

`session.displayCriteria` is clamped to the display the session was built for: a
non-DV panel is asked for the base layer's range, a non-HDR panel for a rate-only
switch — which is also what makes **Match Frame Rate** engage on SDR content.
After the handshake, `controller.currentPanelIsHDR()` is the value to feed back
into `DisplayCapabilities(panelIsCurrentlyHDR:)` for the next session.

Built-in panels (iPhone, iPad, Mac) engage HDR on demand and skip all of this.
`PrismCoreSession.isMasterRejection(_:)` plus `makeMuxedFallbackSession()` stays
as the backstop for the one state no API can prove: Match Content switched off on
an HDR-capable panel.

## How it works

```

The segmentation is ours. MPVKit's libavformat is built without the `hls` muxer,
so `FMP4SegmentWriter` drives the `mp4` muxer with `frag_custom` and cuts where we
say (video keyframes at or after each 6 s boundary), and `MediaPlaylistWriter`
turns those fragments into a playlist. Two production modes exist:

- **Planned (demand-driven)** — the default for seekable VOD. `SegmentPlan` maps
  every segment upfront from the demuxer's keyframe index (trusted only past two
  witnesses: max keyframe gap 60 s, coverage ≥ one target duration), complete
  `PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD` playlists are published before the first packet, and a fetch
  outside the producer's window re-anchors it — `av_seek_frame` to the anchor
  keyframe, fresh muxers with `frag_discont` + `avoid_negative_ts=disabled` so
  `tfdt` carries absolute time and the produced segment sits exactly where the
  playlist promised. After EOF the producer parks and keeps answering demand for
  segments a re-anchor skipped.
- **Sequential** — an EVENT playlist growing head-to-EOF. Used when no trustworthy
  plan exists (live, unknown duration, junk index) and for the muxed-with-bridge
  shape, where re-anchoring would reset an encoder mid-fragment.

The loopback server speaks HTTP/1.1 with keep-alive (bounded per connection and by
an idle timeout), `GET` + `HEAD`, and pipelined requests. Payloads come from a
`SegmentProvider` rather than straight off disk, and a provider that answers
`.pending` gets an early `200` + `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` once a serve passes
2 s — keeping response headers inside AVPlayer's ~3.5 s media watchdog window. A
pending serve that ultimately fails aborts the connection (a truncated transfer
makes AVPlayer retry) instead of framing a cacheable empty `200`.

### Design notes

The things that were expensive to learn, kept here so the next person doesn't pay
for them twice.

**Atmos needs a box FFmpeg drops.** The `CHANNELS="16/JOC"` playlist attribute is
necessary but it is not what engages Atmos. AVFoundation takes the Dolby/MAT route
only when the **`dec3` box** in the init segment carries the TS 103 420 type-A
extension — and FFmpeg's mp4 muxer drops that extension on a stream copy (plain
`ffmpeg -c copy` does the same). So `EAC3Syncframe` reads `complexity_index_type_a`
out of the bitstream's `addbsi` and `EAC3Configuration.patch` appends it to the
produced init segment, re-framing every enclosing box's size. Field placement
follows libavcodec's `ac3_parser.c` rather than a reading of the spec, and that
mattered three times over: the JOC signal can sit in a *dependent* substream
(Blu-ray-style DD+ puts it there, behind an AC-3 core frame), a dependent substream
carries a `chanmap` field an independent one doesn't, and both the converter-sync
bit and the whole mixing-substream block exist on independent substreams only. Each
omission shifted the walk by a bit or two — and a shifted walk does not fail, it
returns a confident wrong number.

**`hvc1` is a promise the record has to keep.** A stream-copied HEVC track is given
an `hvc1` sample entry explicitly, because FFmpeg's mp4 muxer defaults HEVC to
`hev1` and Apple's HLS rules want `hvc1`. But `hvc1` also asserts that every
parameter set lives in that entry, and Matroska `CodecPrivate` routinely says
otherwise (`array_completeness = 0`) — so `HVCCNormalizer` rewrites the record to
VPS/SPS/PPS in order with completeness asserted. It runs **twice**: once on the
input extradata, and again on the produced init segment, because movenc doesn't
copy our record into the sample entry, it rebuilds one and re-zeroes the flag while
still naming the entry `hvc1`. Sources that keep their parameter sets in band
(`numOfArrays = 0`, common in MP4 and MPEG-TS) get them harvested off the first
keyframes and filled in, since an empty `hvcC` under an `hvc1` entry promises Apple
a decoder configuration that isn't there.

**Dolby Vision is three separate claims that must agree.** The manifest's `CODECS`,
the sample entry's fourcc, and the `dvcC`/`dvvC` box all describe the same track,
and AVPlayer checks them against each other. Profile 5 gets `dvh1` as its sample
entry — its picture is IPT-PQc2, not YCbCr, and an `hvc1` entry over P5 renders the
familiar green-and-purple — while 8.x deliberately keeps `hvc1`, because its base
layer really is plain-HEVC-compatible and the `dvvC` box is what upgrades it.
Claiming `dvh1` there would deny the very fallback that makes 8.1 worth having.
The boxes themselves need `-strict unofficial`: they are Dolby's specification
rather than ISO's, movenc refuses to write them by default, and a DV source without
them is HDR10 with extra bytes.

**WebVTT timing states a fact, not a convention.** HLS bridges cue times to the
media timeline with `X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:<t>,LOCAL:<local>`. Our fMP4 segments
carry the source's own stream-copied timestamps, so the media timeline starts at the
first video PTS — there is no MPEG-TS 10 s convention to honour, and assuming one is
exactly what makes fMP4 subtitles render ten seconds late in other implementations.
PrismCore writes cue times relative to the presentation origin and repeats
`MPEGTS:round(origin × 90000),LOCAL:00:00:00.000` in every segment.

**A flagged interlaced source is often lying.** Broadcast H.264 is routinely flagged
interlaced around progressive frames, so the probe decodes a handful of frames before
believing the flag. Evicting those from the native path would trade hardware decode
and Atmos passthrough for deinterlacing nothing.

## Non-goals

Deliberate omissions, so you don't have to read the source to find them:

- **No UI.** No view, no transport bar, no controls, no HUD.
- **No published playback state.** The remux path is a service: it hands you a URL
  and gets out of the way. Your `AVPlayer` remains the source of truth for time,
  rate and status.
- **No subtitle rendering.** Text becomes WebVTT renditions AVPlayer selects
  itself; bitmap tracks are surfaced for a host that wants to draw them.
- **No playlist or queue management.** Make a new session for the next title.
- **No analytics.** Nothing leaves the device, and nothing phones anywhere.
- **No re-encoding of video, ever.** If a frame would have to be touched, that
  source belongs on the software path or somewhere else entirely.

## Requirements

| | Min |
| --- | --- |
| iOS | 16.0 |
| tvOS | 17.0 |
| macOS | 14.0 |
| visionOS | 1.0 |
| Swift | 6.0 |

FFmpeg arrives through [MPVKit](https://github.com/mpvkit/MPVKit)'s **dynamic**
xcframeworks — no FFmpeg source is redistributed here and nothing needs building.
Dolby Vision RPU conversion goes through
[libdovi](https://github.com/quietvoid/dovi_tool), which MPVKit already links.

A host that already ships MPVKit adds **zero new binary dependencies**. One gotcha
if that host vendors its own MPVKit fork: SPM derives a path dependency's identity
from its *directory name*, so the fork's directory has to be called `MPVKit` for it
to override the `mpvkit` identity PrismCore asks for.

## Stability and versioning

PrismCore follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Every `public`
declaration in `Sources/PrismCore/` is the stability contract; `internal` types are
not. Since 1.0.0 that contract is a promise: breaking changes bump the major,
features the minor, fixes the patch — so the ordinary pin is the right one:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Wenzlik/PrismCore.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

Hosts that archive through Xcode Cloud (or any CI with automatic resolution
disabled) should pin an exact version and keep their committed `Package.resolved` in
step with it. A `from:` range lets local resolution ride ahead to a newer tag while
the pinned file stays put, and then a device build and a TestFlight build are quietly
running different engines.

Every release is listed in **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**.

## Integrating it

PrismCore is **LGPL-2.1-or-later with an Application Store Exception** (see
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md)). In practice, for the two cases
that come up:

**Shipping a closed-source app, including on the App Store.** Add the package, use
it, ship it. The exception exists precisely for this: LGPL section 6 asks that your
users be able to relink your app against a modified PrismCore, which a signed `.ipa`
cannot allow, and the exception releases you from that requirement for store
distribution. Two things are asked of you in return:

1. If you **modify PrismCore itself**, those modifications stay LGPL and have to be
   published. Using it unmodified — the normal case — carries no such obligation for
   your own code.
2. Say so somewhere a user can find it (an About screen, an acknowledgements page):
   that your app includes PrismCore, under which licence, and where the source
   lives. Aether's About screen is a worked example.

**FFmpeg is a separate obligation, and it is not new.** The exception covers
PrismCore's own code only. FFmpeg reaches your app as dynamically linked frameworks
under plain LGPL-2.1-or-later, which is satisfiable for a closed-source store app —
that is what every FFmpeg-based app on the App Store already does — provided you
embed them *dynamically*, ship the licence texts, and point at the build's source.
If you already ship MPVKit, you are already doing all three.

Why LGPL rather than something permissive: `Sources/PrismCore/Remux/EAC3Syncframe.swift`
was written by reading FFmpeg's `ac3_parser.c`, because the placement of the Atmos
signal in `addbsi` cannot be derived reliably from the specification alone — three
attempts from the spec produced a confidently *wrong* answer. That makes the file
realistically a derivative of LGPL code, and [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) says so out
loud rather than hoping nobody looks.

## Status

Shipping, and pre-1.0 for the reason the version number suggests: the API is still
free to move, and two headline claims are proven by construction rather than by a lab.

The test suite is 253 tests across 44 suites, hermetic apart from an opt-in
real-media harness. It exercises the playlists, the loopback server, the subtitle
renditions and the audio bridge's decode → resample → FIFO → encode chain, plus
end-to-end remuxes of synthetic fixtures: a two-language master (AAC eng + AC3 ces)
is served over the loopback, re-probed through libavformat's `hls` demuxer with both
codecs and both languages intact, and reaches `.readyToPlay` in a real `AVPlayer`.
Bitmap-subtitle OCR is verified against a real Blu-ray remux, where the served
segments read back the film's own SDH cues.

Being precise about the two headline claims, because "implemented" and "proven" are
not the same thing. **Atmos**: EAC3+JOC stream-copies (proved on a fixture — the
codec survives the round-trip), the rendition declares `CHANNELS="16/JOC"` (the rule
is unit-tested), and the served `dec3` declares complexity index 16 on Dolby's own
demo file. Whether the objects reach a receiver over HDMI is a device question.
**Dolby Vision**: the whole signaling path exists and every rule is pinned by a unit
test, but a synthetic fixture cannot carry an RPU, so Profile 7 conversion is
established only as far as "the library links and the code runs". Both want a device
and real media, and that is what the Aether integration is currently buying.

The software path is exercised headless as far as it can be — the VP9 fixture decodes
to `CVPixelBuffer`s of the right shape on a monotonic, source-anchored timeline, and
the pipeline runs demux → decode → stamp → back-pressure → enqueue against renderer
stand-ins, including the case where a stalled video renderer must not starve audio.
What no headless test can assert is that a frame reached a display. Still open there:
subtitles, track switching, and frame-accurate seek.
